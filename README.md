# How it works:
- You input the dir of images you want to inspect
- If you need to compare you can add as many dirs as you please (be sensible come on you dont have 70" tv as a monitor)
# How to use:
- Add dir: (short cut: Ctrl+A/Command+A)
- Zoom-In/Out: mouse wheel
- Moving around when zoomed in: click with mouse and drag
- Switching images forwards/backwards: Arrow Left (bw)/Arrow Right (fw)
- Removing dir: hold Ctrl/Command + Click , on the image that corresponds with the dir

# Allowed to do:
- Play around with it try to break it and then report any issues that might come up right here with a nice **bug** label: [this is the link trust me no rickroll here](https://github.com/NexFire/PictureExplorer/issues)
- If you have anything that you would like to see to be implemented as an feature in next versionsyou can write it here with nice **new feature** label: [this is still just a proper link](https://github.com/NexFire/PictureExplorer/issues)
- If you have any questions try to answer them your self ( google is a thing ) but if it is question regarding this SW then you can write it here with **question** label: [bro just trust me](https://github.com/NexFire/PictureExplorer/issues)

# Not allowed to do:
- Bitch about that your feature wasnt implemented. Get a life not your personal dev just wait a bit more. In the meantime i recommend this: [a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
